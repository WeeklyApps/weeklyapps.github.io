{"name":"Weekly Apps Developed by Clint, Robert, and Soheil","tagline":"","body":"### About\r\n\r\nEach week, we will be developing a new application and publishing it on Monday nights. The purpose of this is to make cool stuff, learn, and explore the challenges we face without the pressure of making something perfect. Even if it's not 100% complete, we will be publishing what we were able to make and move on to the next idea each week. The first application we will be making is a blog. In the subsequent weeks, we will updating the blog with the challenges we came across in the app we made that week and how we solved the problems we reached. Each project will be open source and we will share all the code we write on the [WeeklyApp GitHub page](https://github.com/WeeklyApp). We will be also be accepting app ideas. Once the blog has been published, please feel free to submit any ideas for an app you would like us to make!\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n* [Clint Cecil](http://clintcecil.com/)\r\n* [Robert McCaffery](http://robertjmccaffery.com/)\r\n* Soheil Varamini\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n* Start a blog to document apps\r\n\r\n### Completed Apps\r\n\r\n# Apps to do\r\n* Blog App\r\n* GTA Map app\r\n* d3.js app\r\n* Fantasy Football draft order app\r\n* App that ties in with Google Maps API and calculates the dollar amount needed for tolls for a route","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
